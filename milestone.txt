CS193X Final Project Milestone
==============================

Project Title: Bucket List Buddies
Your Name: Tracy Wei
Your SUNetID: tracywei

Overview
--------
I have started working on the front-end of the application, focusing on building the user interface using HTML and CSS. I have explored various design options and incorporated some code from Assignment 3.1 as a foundation for the frontend.

Project Changes
---------------
For now, I don't think I'll be making any significant changes from the project proposal.

Implementation Details
----------------------
For the front-end, I am using HTML and CSS to create a user interface similar to the one in Assignment 3.1. The app will contain a homepage with a login prompt, a profile side bar where the user can select a goal, and the main page with the recommended matches. The frontend will contain a User class and App class.
For the back-end, I plan to store the data in MongoDB as a collection called Users and have API endpoints for:
- GET list of users
- GET user information (id, name, email, phone number, goal) from id
- POST for creating a new user
- PATCH for updating bucket list goal

External libraries and code
---------------------------
I am using some of the HTML and CSS from Assignment 3.1 as a starting foundation for my project's frontend since I an also building a "social media" type of app that has a similar UI.

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
Like I stated before, I plan to consult Assignment 3.1 for the frontend. Additionally, I may refer to online resources and documentation for specific HTML and CSS elements, like checkboxes.

Anything else?
