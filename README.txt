Overview

"Bucket List Buddies" is a social app that connects users to other users through their shared interests in activities.

To run the project, you need to `npm install` and `npm start`.
Do we need to load data from init_db.mongodb? Yes.

Features
--------
<TODO: This doesn't have to be a comprehensive list. But if there's anything we should definitely try or might miss, this is a good place to let us know about that.>

Collaboration and libraries
---------------------------
<TODO: Identify any sources you have consulted or libraries/external code you used. If your project overlaps with another project or coursework for another class, please describe the overlap and the parts specific to you/193X here.>
My project overlaps with Assignment 3.1 and 3.2, which provided the foundation of this social media app. I used the HTML/CSS from the assignments to get started with my project and changed and added more HTML/CSS to better fit what I wanted to do in the project (ie. changing the posts to look like cards on a board instead of a row per post, making a profile section, adding a login and logout form, etc.). As for the JavaScript frontend, I also used the assignments' as a foundation but built and edited on top of it to adjust to the features I added in my project (ie. bucket list vs. other posts sections, the buddies list, adding/checking off items, messaging, etc.). Lastly, since the assignments' backend was similar to what was needed for my project, I used that but added on more routes that were needed for the features unique to my project (ie. getting buddies list, adding/removing items, etc.).

Anything else?
-------------
As a web dev beginner, I learned so much from this class!
